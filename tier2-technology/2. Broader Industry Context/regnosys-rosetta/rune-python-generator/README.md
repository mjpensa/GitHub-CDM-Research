# Rune Python Generator

The Rune Python Generator creates Python code from [Rune](https://github.com/finos/rune-dsl).  It fully supports the Rune type syntax and has comprehensive [expression coverage](./EXPRESSION_SUPPORT.md), though function generation is not yet fully implemented.

The generated code requires the [RunePythonRuntime](https://github.com/finos/rune-python-runtime) library and Python 3.11+.

## Releases

Releases are [triggered manually](./.github/workflows.yml) and follow a four-part semantic versioning scheme (x.y.z.n). The first three numbers match the **rosetta.dsl.version** in the **pom.xml**, and the fourth number tracks generator changes.

For example, when the DSL version updates to **9.64.1**, the first release will be tagged **9.64.1.0**. Subsequent releases will only increment the fourth digit (e.g., **9.64.1.1**) until the DSL version changes again.

Releases **should** not be manually tagged.

### Release Notes

The features of the current version can be found in the [release notes](./RELEASE.md)

### Rune-DSL Updates

The Renovate bot automatically handles DSL updates by creating a pull request. Maintainers can merge this PR if it passes the automated build and unit tests. Manual changes including a new PR are required if the tests fail.

## Repository Organization

- `README.md` - this file, for documentation purposes
- `BUILDANDTEST.md` - instructions on building and testing the repo
- `RELEASE.md` - information about the current release
- `src/main`  - Java/Xtend code to generate Python from Rune
- `src/test`  - Java/Xtend code to run JUnit tests on the code generation process
- `build` - configuration scripts to setup and tear down the Python unit testing environment
- `build/build_cdm.sh` - used to create a Python package using CDM Rune definitions
- `test` - Python unit tests and scripts to run the tests

## Development setup

### For developers

This guide is meant for everyone who wants to contribute to the Rune Python Generator and needs to get things up and running.

Detailed build and testing instructions can be found in [BUILDANDTEST.md](./BUILDANDTEST.md)

Troubleshooting: If you run into issues, please open an [issue](https://github.com/finos/rune-python-generator/issues). This helps us improve the guide for everyone.

### 1. Building with Maven

Start by cloning the project: `git clone https://github.com/finos/rune-python-generator`

Our project runs with Java 21. Make sure that your Maven also uses this version of Java by running `mvn -v`.

To build the project, run `mvn clean package`.

#### UNIT Testing

Building the project using Maven will run JUNIT-based unit tests.  All tests should pass.  To run the Python unit tests follow the instructions in [BUILDANDTEST.md](./BUILDANDTEST.md)

### 2. Setting things up in Eclipse

#### Install Eclipse IDE for Java and DSL Developers

Install version `2025-06` of the "Eclipse IDE for Java and DSL Developers" using the [Eclipse Installer](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer). You might have to enable "Advanced Mode" in the settings of the Eclipse Installer to install a specific version.

#### Configure Eclipse with the right version of Java

Xtend files cannot be built with any Java version later than 21. In Eclipse, go to Settings... > Java > Installed JREs and make sure the checked JRE points to a Java version of 21.

#### Install the Checkstyle plugin

We use [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/) for enforcing good coding practices. The Eclipse plugin for Checkstyle can be found here: [https://checkstyle.org/eclipse-cs/#!/](https://checkstyle.org/eclipse-cs/#!/).

#### Open the project in Eclipse

Go to Import... > Existing Maven Project, select the right folder, click Finish.

### Standalone CLI

To generate Python code from a single file or directory, after building the project use the standalone CLI by executing the following command:

```bash
java -cp target/python-0.0.0.main-SNAPSHOT.jar com.regnosys.rosetta.generator.python.PythonCodeGeneratorCLI
```

### Generating CDM from Rune

To generate the Python version of the Common Domain Model (CDM), use the **build_cdm.sh** script. This script uses the branch specified in the file and creates a wheel in target/python-cdm.

```bash
test/cdm_tests/cdm_setup/build_cdm.sh
```

To use a different version of CDM, simply update the **CDM_VERSION** variable in the script.

## Roadmap, Contributing, Getting in Touch, and Governance

### Roadmap

The project roadmap is aligned with the [Rune-DSL](https://github.com/finos/rune-dsl/) and [CDM](https://github.com/finos/common-domain-model/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) roadmaps.
