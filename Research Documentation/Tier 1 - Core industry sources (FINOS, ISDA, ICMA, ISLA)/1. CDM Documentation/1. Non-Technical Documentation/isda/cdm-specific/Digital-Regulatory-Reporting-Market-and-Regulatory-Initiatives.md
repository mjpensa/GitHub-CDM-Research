Digital Regulatory 
Reporting: Market 
and Regulatory 
Initiatives
The complexity and cost of global efforts to improve the data quality 
of derivatives regulatory reporting create a variety of challenges for 
market participants and policy-makers.
These concerns – and the opportunity to mitigate them as major 
changes to reporting rules are implemented over the next two years – 
have become a powerful impetus behind digital regulatory reporting 
(DRR) initiatives. Broadly defined, DRR refers to the publication of 
reporting rules by regulators and/or the implementation of derivatives 
reporting requirements by market participants via human-readable, 
machine-executable code.
DRR will allow regulators to publish reporting rules as executable 
code that can be automatically read and interpreted by the IT 
systems of reporting entities, improving the reporting process across 
asset classes. Regulated entities will be able to automatically execute 
new and amended regulatory reporting rules using an industry-led 
standardized interpretation of the requirements as free open-source 
code.
This paper explains what DRR is, reviews its potential benefits and 
describes the various initiatives that are under way. In particular, 
the paper highlights the work of ISDA and market participants to 
enable all firms to implement regulatory reporting rules consistently 
using the open-source Common Domain Model (CDM). The paper 
also describes several DRR initiatives launched by policy-makers that 
involved collaboration with market participants.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
As the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has noted, “[r]egulatory reporting has become increasingly complex 
and expensive for regulated institutions. In addition, poor quality reporting and/or delayed data can create 
challenges for authorities…”1
.
These concerns, combined with the challenges of complying with new and amended reporting regulations 
in different jurisdictions over the next few years, have become powerful drivers of DRR initiatives by both 
the official and private sectors. 
Market participants are working together on a mutualized, industry-wide DRR initiative for the amended 
US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and European Market Infrastructure Regulation 
(EMIR) trade reporting requirements, which will enable firms to interpret and implement regulatory 
reporting rules consistently via human-readable, machine-executable code using the CDM. 
This DRR initiative will create a standardized data model with unambiguous data-driven logic. Instead of 
each firm individually creating a regulatory reporting solution based on its own interpretation of the rules, 
market participants are developing an industry-led standardized interpretation of the regulation as free 
open-source code. 
With the CFTC’s revised swap data reporting rules coming into force in December 2022, ISDA and 
over 30 contributing firms are currently prioritizing digitization of the CFTC requirements to help 
market participants comply with these amendments. ISDA is also working with market participants on 
digitization of the revised EU trade reporting requirements under EMIR, currently anticipated to go live 
in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
Policy-makers have launched several DRR-related initiatives in recent years that have involved 
collaboration with market participants. These include pilots and projects by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) and Bank of England (BoE)2
, the Group-of-20 (G-20) TechSprint initiative3
, a European 
Commission (EC) tender to develop machine-readable and executable reporting (MRER) as a proof of 
concept4
, and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub’s Project Ellipse5

CHALLENGES IN THE CURRENT REGULATORY 
REPORTING PROCESS
Derivatives regulatory reporting requirements have been implemented in all major jurisdictions around 
the world. The explosion of data has brought more transparency to derivatives markets and enabled 
regulators to better monitor market activity and identify risks. However, it has also resulted in numerous 
challenges.
For market participants, these challenges include the operational costs and burdens of building and 
maintaining reporting regimes in different countries. Regulators have recognized the need for greater 
consistency and accuracy in reporting and are reviewing their rules with the aim of adopting globally 
harmonized data elements. But many have also imposed jurisdiction-specific reporting specifications and 
rules that require distinctive infrastructure builds. 
Even within an individual jurisdiction, firms face operational challenges in regulatory reporting, such as 
interpreting reporting requirements and determining what data inputs to use for specific data fields. 
To comply, each individual institution needs to allocate significant resources and budget. Interpreting the 
regulations incorrectly could have serious legal, operational and financial consequences. To reduce this 
risk, many smaller firms use external professional services to help interpret the requirements correctly. 
Larger firms have in-house compliance teams dedicated to these tasks.
In previous years, significant industry effort has been spent on working with policy-makers to understand 
the precise expectations for specific regulatory requirements. Where regulators have inconsistent 
jurisdictional trade reporting mandates for the same requirement, trade associations like ISDA have 
worked with market participants to develop and agree a standard approach.
Industry best practice documents would typically be drafted and published on the web. Institutions would 
then use their own resources to translate each industry best practice into clearly defined and operationally 
feasible instructions that could be built into their reporting logic and systems. This approach leaves the 
door open for interpretation differences between industry participants for an identical requirement. 
When regulatory reporting changes are implemented, the cycle begins again. Infrastructure builds, 
validation and testing of data outputs to ensure compliance and related work is required by market 
participants. 
Rule amendments result in industry best practice being reassessed, revised and republished. This leads to 
delays between data reporting amendments being published by policy-makers and implemented by firms. 
Inefficient regulatory reporting processes also create challenges for regulators, as poor data quality and 
delayed data can affect their ability to effectively supervise and monitor financial markets.

DERIVATIVES REPORTING RULES 
CHANGES ON THE HORIZON
Regulatory reporting requirements in major jurisdictions are set for significant changes in 2022 and 2023. 
This is prompting interest in DRR, as these initiatives will result in greater consistency across firms and 
systems, creating efficiency and further improving the quality of data for regulators.
Much of the forthcoming changes stem from the G-20 objective for authorities to effectively aggregate 
trade data for analysis. Subsequent work by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures 
(CPMI), the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the FSB has resulted in 
global recommendations for the standardization of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives data reported to 
trade repositories (TRs)6
.
For example, CPMI-IOSCO technical guidance on the harmonization of critical OTC derivatives data 
elements (CDEs) other than unique transaction identifiers (UTIs) and unique product identifiers (UPIs)7
is intended to enhance consistency, which will help authorities better assess risks to financial stability8
.
The guidance does not prescribe which CDEs should be reported in each jurisdiction. Instead, it provides 
harmonized definitions, formats and allowable values for more than 100 recommended data elements 
related to dates, counterparties, clearing, trading, confirmation, settlement, valuation, collateral and 
margin, prices, notional amounts, payments, packages, links and custom baskets. 
Multiple regulators have committed to rewrite their reporting rules to adopt the CDEs. However, they 
have varied the number and type of CDE elements they will introduce in their reporting regimes.
In the US, the CFTC’s amendments overhaul parts 45, 46 and 49 of the swap data record-keeping and 
reporting requirements and part 43 of the real-time public reporting requirements by incorporating CDEs 
agreed by CPMI-IOSCO, as well as changing certain other CFTC-specific data fields9
.
In the EU, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published a final report on technical 
standards under the EMIR REFIT regulation in December 2020 that covers data reporting to TRs, 
procedures to reconcile and validate data, access by the relevant authorities to data and registration of 
TRs10. ESMA also included CDEs in this report. The rules are expected to come into force in the second 
half of 2023. 
Both the CFTC and ESMA will also require the inclusion of UPIs, as well as a new ISO 20022 
messaging standard. Unless the compliance dates for these new standards are aligned with amendments to 
incorporate CDEs, both changes will likely result in further overhauls to reporting systems, with some of 
the logic developed to implement the current requirements having to be discarded and replaced.

DRR AND CDM
DRR is a mutualized industry-wide initiative championed by ISDA that will enable firms to interpret 
and implement regulatory reporting rules consistently via a common machine-readable code based on the 
CDM. 
The initiative will create a free open-source standardized model with data-driven logic. Instead of each firm 
individually interpreting the rules and creating its own regulatory reporting solution, market participants 
will work together to develop a standardized interpretation of the regulation published as code that each 
firm can implement in its systems. 
More than 40 institutions, including buy- and sell-side market participants, have contributed to ISDA’s 
CDM DRR working groups. Members participate in weekly industry meetings and bilateral calls to model 
the regulatory reporting rules based on peer-reviewed interpretations of the requirements.
The current focus of the DRR working groups is the CFTC’s revised swap data reporting rules, which 
come into force at the end of 2022. 
Each of the 128 data elements from the CFTC regulation is being defined, digitized and modelled into 
the CDM, as appropriate, and then discussed and validated by the working group. Different members of 
the working group take the lead on different data elements, sharing the resulting work with the others, 
which makes the process significantly more efficient. 
As of March 2022, more than 70% of the modelling for the CFTC’s rules across five asset classes had been 
completed. In the first and second quarters of 2022, members reviewed, tested and validated digitization 
outputs with project tools. To validate the DRR output, ISDA will use portfolios of anonymized trade 
data from participants and will produce trade reports against which firms can validate their internal builds. 
Phase two of the DRR program will focus on digitization of the reporting rules under EMIR, as well as 
requirements set by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Monetary Authority 
of Singapore (MAS). While the rules will not be entirely identical, ISDA expects a large proportion of the 
globally harmonized data elements (such as CDEs) that are being coded for the CFTC requirements will 
be fully or partially reused elsewhere. 
Adoption of DRR using the CDM by reporting parties and repositories, and acceptance by regulators, 
will promote alignment across the market. If changes are necessary due to regulatory clarifications or 
modifications, the reporting code can be altered centrally and then deployed consistently by all firms using 
DRR. This includes fundamental changes like ISO 20022, which many regulators, including the CFTC, 
are expected to adopt. Regulators will have access to this code, giving them full transparency into how the 
rules are being applied.
This has the potential to change the nature of regulatory engagement, with the prospect of an iterative 
approach to technical regulations. Regulators will be able to consult at a high level on changes and ask the 
industry to propose solutions in the CDM that show what the impact might be in a test environment with 
real test data. 
ISDA will work with firms to develop a mutualized solution for implementing the global requirements for 
UPIs and the ISO 20022 messaging schema through DRR. 
The CDM can integrate and work in a complementary way with any relevant data standards, including 
ISO 20022. Likewise, the CDM can be integrated into the internal systems of market participants, 
allowing multiple data and messaging formats to be consistently converted to the CDM format. 
Regulatory rules and industry best practice logic can be applied, and the necessary output format (ISO 
20022) can be created consistently and seamlessly.

11 The Future of Risk, Capital and Margin Reporting www.isda.org/2021/05/20/the-future-of-risk-capital-and-margin-reporting
What is the CDM?
The Common Domain Model (CDM) is an open-source, human-readable and machine-executable 
data model for derivatives products, processes and calculations. It introduces a digital 
representation of trade agreements, regulatory reporting and trade events across the lifecycle of all 
financial products and includes synonyms (translators) that convert messages from other standards 
into the CDM format.
By creating a common digital representation of events and processes that occur throughout a trade 
lifecycle, the CDM allows market participants to achieve consistency in the processing of trades 
and the interpretation and implementation of complex requirements.
Examples include the affirmation/confirmation of trades, calculation and exchange of margin 
requirements and generation and categorization of risk and capital data – for instance, data 
represented in ISDA’s Common Risk Interchange Format11.
The CDM can also be used to apply clearing rule books to portfolios to determine which trades 
need to be cleared, and analyze legal agreement data across portfolios to determine specific risks 
or features.

REGULATORY DRR-RELATED INITIATIVES
Several DRR-related initiatives have been launched in recent years, including the FCA and BoE 
TechSprints, the FCA and BoE DRR initiative, the G-20 TechSprint 2020, the EC’s tender to develop the 
MRER as a proof of concept, and the BIS Innovation Hub’s Project Ellipse.
The FCA and BoE Pilots and Initiatives
The FCA has held several TechSprints, resulting in a proof of concept demonstrating that a small set of 
reporting instructions can be converted into machine‑executable code. Machines then used the code to 
automatically carry out/execute the instructions, pulling the required information directly from a firm’s 
systems12,13.
Following the TechSprints, the FCA and BoE launched their DRR initiative in 2018 to explore the use 
of technology to help firms meet their regulatory reporting requirements in a more effective and efficient 
way. The initiative aims to examine the feasibility of a model-driven and machine-readable regulatory 
environment that could transform how the financial services industry understands, interprets and reports 
regulatory information14. 
The initiative will enable firms to digitally tag data, allowing it to be identified according to agreed 
standards. As a result, it will be possible to easily identify the same data across various institutions. 
Regulators could publish a digital version of reporting instructions that reference the common data 
standards agreed with firms, which could be distributed to those institutions15. 
Two pilot phases have been completed so far, and phase three is set to follow. The pilot phases represent a 
collaboration between the BoE, FCA, Barclays, Credit Suisse, HSBC, Lloyds, Nationwide, Natwest and 
Santander. 
Phase one of the DRR pilot took place in the second half of 2018. The focus was to improve the quality 
of regulatory data by exploring how to make reporting rules and instructions less reliant on human 
interpretation and implementation.
The pilot participants created a regulatory reporting prototype that involved converting regulation into 
code using the CDM, defining standardized firm data and implementing machine-executable regulation 
against that standardized data. 
In the prototype, machine-executable versions of the regulation were created as smart contracts. These 
smart contracts were loaded into the virtual nodes that represented regulators and then distributed to the 
virtual nodes that represented regulated firms. The codified regulation was then executed against synthetic 
data supplied by the firms in a standardized format. However, technology and processes used to build the 
prototype needed further development to be deployed as a live system.
The focus of phase two was to assess the economic viability of DRR, explore technical solutions for the 
creation of machine-executable regulation and definition of data, and further develop and test processes 
for the definition of data and creation of machine-executable regulation explored in phase one16.

Phase three of the DRR pilot focuses on improving regulatory interpretation, implementation and 
execution, as well as delivering data. The FCA is in the process of establishing the requirements necessary 
to create machine-readable and machine-executable regulation. This involves alignment on definitions, 
interpretation and implementation of rules and data definitions and scaling technology-driven reporting 
solutions across the financial industry17. 
G-20 TechSprint 2020 
The G-20 TechSprint 2020 was a virtual hackathon organized by the BIS Innovation Hub and the Saudi 
G-20 presidency. The event was designed to highlight the potential for new technologies to resolve 
operational problems in regulatory compliance and supervision across three categories: regulatory 
reporting; monitoring and surveillance; and dynamic information sharing18.
In the regulatory reporting category, entrants were asked to develop tools to enable regulators to easily 
prepare and transmit machine-readable and machine-executable regulations to their regulated entities, 
allowing regulatory data to be easily mined and reported.
As part of the competition, ISDA and technology firm REGnosys developed a DRR pilot for derivatives 
reporting regulations using the CDM. The solution enabled reporting firms to access an executable code 
version of regulatory requirements set by the MAS and then run trades through a reporting engine to 
validate the business logic, which could be used consistently across the market19.
EC MRER Tender
The EC launched a tender in February 2020 to develop a proof-of-concept MRER for requirements 
specified in the revised EMIR legislation. The objective is to assess whether MRER can lead to a 
more effective and efficient development of reporting requirements and reduce the reporting burden 
for institutions. The project also aims to identify regulatory obstacles to MRER technology-enabled 
innovation in the financial sector20.
The proof of concept is intended to demonstrate the benefit of MRER during the design of new reporting 
requirements and their integration into the information systems of reporting entities and supervisors. 
Specifically, it will focus on transaction-reporting requirements of the EMIR REFIT regulation. 
As part of the initiative, the reporting requirements currently written in natural language will be converted 
into executable code. This code could be automatically read and interpreted by the IT systems of reporting 
entities, allowing for the creation of reports in the format required by supervisors. 
Project Ellipse
Project Ellipse is a proof of concept launched by the BIS Innovation Hub to explore how regulatory 
authorities could better use data and technology to help them identify and assess emerging risks in real 
time. The goal is to enable regulators to digitally extract and analyze vast amounts of data from diverse 
resources21. 
During the first phase of the project between January and September 2021, the BIS Innovation Hub, the 
MAS, the BoE and ISDA collaborated to explore the concept of cross-border digital regulatory reporting 
using a machine-executable data model.

Using the reporting requirements for retail mortgages in the UK and Singapore, the project explored 
whether authorities in different jurisdictions could establish common baseline reporting requirements. 
A set of common requirements was developed for the collection of retail mortgage data, which was based 
on the main components of mortgages and represented the type of data required by both authorities for 
supervisory purposes. Key data attributes of retail mortgages were identified, and data definitions were 
sourced.
The project modelled the identified mortgage attributes using the CDM. Executable code automatically 
generated from the model definitions enabled retail mortgage reports to be created for Singapore and the 
UK referencing the same model22. 
Phase two explores the use of advanced analytics (such as artificial intelligence) and machine learning 
to mine unstructured sources of data and highlight correlations between current events and supervisory 
metrics23.
These DRR-related initiatives have collectively demonstrated the potential to improve the regulatory 
reporting process, enabling it to be more efficient, accurate and timely, and less costly.

CONCLUSION
The current regulatory reporting process is complex, time consuming and expensive for regulated 
institutions. Inefficient regulatory reporting processes also create a challenge for regulators as data quality 
can affect their ability to effectively supervise and monitor financial markets.
Major changes in regulatory reporting are slated for 2022 and 2023. These changes present an opportunity 
for firms and regulators to adopt DRR to standardize, automate and improve derivatives data reporting.
The adoption of DRR can bring multiple benefits for both industry participants and regulators:
• DRR will enable regulated entities to automatically execute new and amended regulatory reporting 
rules using an industry-led standardized interpretation of the regulation as free open-source code.
• DRR will allow regulators to publish reporting rules as executable code that can be automatically read 
and interpreted by reporting entities’ IT systems, improving the reporting process across asset classes.
• As a mutualized initiative, DRR creates industry-wide engagement and cooperation. 
• DRR will create an industry-led standardized interpretation of the regulation published as code that 
each firm can implement in its systems. 
• Firms will be able to save time, resources and budget as they will not need to individually interpret the 
reporting rules. 
• DRR will create a greater consistency of how rules are interpreted and implemented across market 
participants. 
• A standardized interpretation of regulations will promote greater alignment between regulators and 
market participants. 
• Improved data quality will enhance regulatory supervision of the markets.
• DRR will help incorporate and enhance the effectiveness of global standards, including CDE fields, the 
ISO 20022 message format, UPIs, UTIs and LEIs.
• DRR can be consistently applied across jurisdictions and used for reporting of different asset classes. 
• DRR could enable regulators to automatically query the underlying transaction data and generate 
regulatory metrics referencing the standardized data.
• DRR could revolutionize the nature of regulation.
